I am reading "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari. While reading a specific paragraph, I had this weird thought. This is completely random, so no judgements.

> The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation. Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell. But it’s more important to understand the consequences of the Tree of Knowledge mutation than its causes. What was so special about the new Sapiens language that it enabled us to conquer the world?

What if humans figured out a way to get nutrients through a different way instead of our natural way. Something like, we inject nutrients, but not eat. i.e, we stop using our mouth. What if at some point of time, we figure out a ways to record our brain waves and send messages using just our thoughts.

Do we then mutate interms of cognition again? Plus a whole physical mutation too? Another evolution where we end up like the aliens we usually imagine to be. No mouth. Big brains. The chances are too high, I declare.
