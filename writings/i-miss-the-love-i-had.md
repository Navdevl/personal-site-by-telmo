This is just a friday evening, after a long hours of interviews all throughout this week. And I listen to this one old song, that I had in my playlist during my school days. It took me to the days where we all had facebook and trying to catch a huge number of likes. 

I miss listening to those songs without any thoughts about the office meetings or the next month's EMI. It was a moment filled only with pure joy, happiness and I am fully absorbed in the moment..
