* There are four ways of enabling discipline: delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth and balancing.
* The the feeling of being valuable is essential to mental health and is a corner stone of self-discipline.
* Problems do not go away. They must be worked through or else they remain forever a barrier to the growth and development of the spirit.
* The inclination to ignore the problems is a simple manifestation of unwillingness to delay gratification.
* It is said, "Neurotics makes themselves miserable; but those with character disorder make everyone else miserable."
* In attempting to avoid the pain of responsibility, millions and even billions daily attempt to escape from freedom.
* Frequently people's need to cling to their own reality-definition(maps), and fight against losing them is so great that therapy becomes impossible.
* No act is more unnatural, and hence more human, than the act of entering psychotherapy.
* Genuine psychotherapy is a legitimate shortcut to personal growth which often is ignored.
* To be free, we must assume total responsibility for ourselves, but in doing so, one must possess the capacity to reject the responsibility that is not truly theirs.
* Sometimes giving up is integral part of growing up.
* What provides the motive, the energy for discipline? The force I believe is love.
* Love is too large, too deep ever to be truly understood or measured or limited within a framework of words.
* Love is not effortless, but on the contrary, love is effortful.
* By the time of mid-adolescence, young people know that they are individuals, confined to the boundaries of their flesh and the limits of their power, each one relatively frail and impotent organism, existing only by cooperation within a group of fellow organisms called society.
* We can choose how to respond to the experience of falling in love, but we cannot choose the experience itself.
* The sexual specificity of the phenomenon leads me to suspect that it is genetically determined instinctual component of mating behaviour. In simple words, falling in love is stereotypic response of human beings to a configuration of internal sexual drives and external sexual stimuli, which serves to increase the  probability of sexual pairing and bonding so as to enhance the survival of the human species.
* **_Cathexis_** is defined as the process of allocation of mental or emotional energy to a person, object, or idea.
* It is impossible to see the unity of the universe as long as one continues to see oneself as discrete object, separate and distinguishable from the rest of the universe.
* One must fine one's self before one can lose it. You cannot give up on a thing that you don't have.
* Two people love each other only when they are quite capable of living without each other but choose to live with each other.
* There is a paradox in love; that it is selfish and unselfish at the same time.
* Even after marriage, one may meet a person who strongly attracts them, but because it would be destructive to their marriage, they will say vocally or say in the silence of their heart, "I feel like loving you, but I am not going to".
